I tried multiple times to deploy the project online (Netlify, Render, Vercel), but unfortunately I couldnâ€™t complete the deployment successfully  
https://event-management-system-j3ti-lehdjfmlc-rawan-2112s-projects.vercel.app
npm start https://stellular-sunburst-6f5034.netlify.app/ 

However, the full project is working fine locally.

To run the backend:

npm run dev 

To run the frontend:

cd frontend/client
