I tried multiple times to deploy the project online (Netlify, Render, Vercel), but unfortunately I couldnâ€™t complete the deployment successfully due to build and routing issues.

However, the full project is working fine locally.

To run the backend:

npm run dev


To run the frontend:

cd frontend/client
npm start
